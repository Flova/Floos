# Floos
Floos is a simple social network, written is PHP.
It was created in the time from ca. 2012-2014.
It was my first real programming project (I was about 13) and it is not up to my current coding standards (DON'T USE IT except for some experiments).
Maybe it gets some small refactoring, but the ground structure should stay the same for "historic" reasons.
